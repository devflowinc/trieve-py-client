# RecommendChunksRequest


## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**filters** | [**ChunkFilter**](ChunkFilter.md) |  | [optional] 
**limit** | **int** | The number of chunks to return. This is the number of chunks which will be returned in the response. The default is 10. | [optional] 
**negative_chunk_ids** | **List[str]** | The ids of the chunks to be used as negative examples for the recommendation. The chunks in this array will be used to filter out similar chunks. | [optional] 
**negative_tracking_ids** | **List[str]** | The tracking_ids of the chunks to be used as negative examples for the recommendation. The chunks in this array will be used to filter out similar chunks. | [optional] 
**positive_chunk_ids** | **List[str]** | The ids of the chunks to be used as positive examples for the recommendation. The chunks in this array will be used to find similar chunks. | [optional] 
**positive_tracking_ids** | **List[str]** | The tracking_ids of the chunks to be used as positive examples for the recommendation. The chunks in this array will be used to find similar chunks. | [optional] 
**recommend_type** | **str** | The type of recommendation to make. This lets you choose whether to recommend based off of &#x60;semantic&#x60; or &#x60;fulltext&#x60; similarity. The default is &#x60;semantic&#x60;. | [optional] 
**slim_chunks** | **bool** | Set slim_chunks to true to avoid returning the content and chunk_html of the chunks. This is useful for when you want to reduce amount of data over the wire for latency improvement (typicall 10-50ms). Default is false. | [optional] 
**strategy** | **str** | Strategy to use for recommendations, either \&quot;average_vector\&quot; or \&quot;best_score\&quot;. The default is \&quot;average_vector\&quot;. The \&quot;average_vector\&quot; strategy will construct a single average vector from the positive and negative samples then use it to perform a pseudo-search. The \&quot;best_score\&quot; strategy is more advanced and navigates the HNSW with a heuristic of picking edges where the point is closer to the positive samples than it is the negatives. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from trieve_py_client.models.recommend_chunks_request import RecommendChunksRequest

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of RecommendChunksRequest from a JSON string
recommend_chunks_request_instance = RecommendChunksRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(RecommendChunksRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
recommend_chunks_request_dict = recommend_chunks_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of RecommendChunksRequest from a dict
recommend_chunks_request_form_dict = recommend_chunks_request.from_dict(recommend_chunks_request_dict)
